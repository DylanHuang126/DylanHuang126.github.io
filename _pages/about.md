Welcome! 

I am a research assistant in [Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis (NLPSA) Lab](https://academiasinicanlplab.github.io) at Academia Sinica-the most important research institute in Taiwan-supervised by [Dr. Lun-Wei Ku](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/lwku/). My research interests lie at Machine Learning and Deep Learning for recommender system, aspects extraction, and hyperbolic space embedding.

Previously I spent a year working with [Prof. Chien-Chin Chen](https://management.ntu.edu.tw/en/IM/faculty/teacher/sn/22) on fakenews detection.

I like to cook, read books, and do weight training during my free time.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research or have any questions. I am more than happy to hear from you! 

Here is my CV: [Liang-Ying Huang's CV](files/CV.pdf)
